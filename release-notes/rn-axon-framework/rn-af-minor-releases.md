# Minor Releases

Any patch release made for an Axon project is tailored towards resolving bugs. This page aims to provide a dedicated overview of patch releases per project.

## _Release 4.3_

### Release 4.3.1

* Through the new [Create-or-Update](../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/command-handlers.md#aggregate-command-handler-creation-policy)

  feature a bug was introduced which didn't allow non-String aggregate identifiers.

  This problem was quickly resolved in [\#1363](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1363),

  allowing the usage of "complex" aggregate identifiers once more.

* The graceful shutdown process introduced in 4.3 had a couple of minor problems.

  One of which was the shutdown order within the `AxonServerCommandBus` and `AxonServerQueryBus`,

  which basically made it so that the approach prior to 4.3 was maintained.

  We also noticed that the `AxonServerConnectionManager` never shutdown nicely.

  All of these, plus some other minor fixes, have been performed in [\#1372](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1372).

* The `AggregateCreationPolicy#ALWAYS` did not behave as expected, resulting in faulty behaviour when used.

  Pull request [\#1371](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1371) saw an end to this problem,

  ensuring the desired usage of all newly introduced creation policies.

## _Release 4.2_

### Release 4.2.2

* In a distributed setup, the `DisruptorCommandBus` was not always correctly identified as being the local segment.

  Due to this, aggregate repositories weren't created by the `DisruptorCommandBus` as is required in such a configuration.

  This was marked in [\#874](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/874) and resolved through [\#1287](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1287).

* As described in [\#1274](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1274),

  a query handler with return type `Future` was not being returned at all but threw an exception.

  Pull request [\#1323](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1323) solved that in 4.2.2.

* An issue was solved where the `JdbcAutoConfiguration` unintentionally depended on a JPA specific class.

### Release 4.2.1

* A one-to-many `Upcaster` instance tied to Axon Server would only use the first event result and ignore the rest.

  This issue has been resolved in pull request [\#1264](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1264).

* The `axon-legacy` module's `GapAwareTrackingToken` did not implement the `TrackingToken` interface.

  This was marked in issue [\#1230](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1230) and resolved in [\#1231](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1231).

* The builders of the `ExponentialBackOffIntervalRetryScheduler` and `IntervalRetryScheduler` previously

  did not implement the `validate()` method correctly.

  Through this a `NullPointerException` could occur on start-up,

  as marked in [\#1293](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1293).

## _Release 4.1_

### Release 4.1.2

* A dependency on `XStream` was enforced undesirably through the Builder pattern introduced in 4.0.

  This has been resolved by using a `Supplier` of a `Serializer` in the Builders instead, as described under [this](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1054) issue.

* Due to a hierarchy issue in the Spring Boot auto configuration, the `JdbcTokenStore` was not always used as expected.

  The ordering has been fixed under issue [\#1077](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1077).

* The ordering of message handling functions was incorrect according to the documentation.

  Classes take precedence over interface, and the depth of interface hierarchy is calculated based on the inheritance level \(as described [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1129)\).

### Release 4.1.1

* Query Dispatch Interceptors were no called correctly when a [subscription query](../../axon-framework/queries/query-dispatchers.md#subscription-queries) was performed when Axon Server was used as the `QueryBus`.

  This issue was marked [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1013) and resolved in pull request [\#1042](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1042).

* When Axon Server was \(auto\) configured without being able to connect to an actual instance, processing instructions were incorrectly dispatched regardless.

  Pull request [\#1040](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1040) resolves this by making sure an active connection is present.

* The Spring Boot auto configuration did not allow the exclusion of the `axon-server-connector` dependency due to a direct dependency on classes.

  This has been resolved by expecting fully qualified class names as Strings instead \(resolved under [this](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1041) pull request\).

* The `JpaEventStorageEngine` was not wrapping the `appendEvents` operation in a transaction.

  Problem has been resolved under issue [\#1035](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1035).

## Release 4.0

### Release 4.0.4

* Deserialization failures were accidentally swallowed by the command and query gateway \(marked under [\#967](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/967)\).
* Resolved an issue where custom exception in a Command Handling constructor caused `NullPointerExceptions`.

### Release 4.0.3

* The `SimpleQueryBus` reported exceptions on the initial result incorrectly upon performing a subscription query.

  Issue has been described and resolved under [\#913](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/913).

* Resolved issue where the the "download Axon Server" message was shown upon a reconnect of an application to a Axon Server node.
* Large global index gaps between events caused issues when querying the event stream \(described [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/419)\).
* Fixed inconsistency in the `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken#covers(TrackingToken)` method.

### Release 4.0.2

* A timeout was thrown instead of a exception by Axon Server when a duplicate aggregate id was created, which is resolved in [\#903](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/903). 
* Command or Query handling exception were no properly serialized through Axon Server \(resolved in [\#904](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/904)\).

### Release 4.0.1

* Resolved `QueryUpdateEmitter` configuration for the Axon Server connector set up \(see issue [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/896)\).
* For migration purposes legacy `TrackingTokens` should have been added, which is resolved [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/886).
* Event Processing was stopped after a reconnection with Axon Server. Resolve the problem in issue [\#883](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/883).
