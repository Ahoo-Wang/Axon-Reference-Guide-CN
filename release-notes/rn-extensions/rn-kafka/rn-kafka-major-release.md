# Major Releases

This page notes all enhancements and features that we have introduced to our major releases of the Axon Kafka Extension.

## Release 4.0

We split off the Kafka logic from Axon Framework core into a dedicated repository.
Next to that, it complies with Axon Framework's 4.0 release.

Note that we adjusted the Kafka package into a _release candidate_.
As such, users should consider we might introduce API changes in future releases.
