# Major Releases

This page notes all enhancements and features that we have introduced to our major releases of the Axon AMQP Extension.

## Release 4.3

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.3.

## Release 4.2

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.2.

## Release 4.1

A version predicament caused the extension to load the wrong package for the `ChannelAwareMessageListener`.
We resolved this issue for release 4.1 [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-amqp/issues/1).

Furthermore, we updated the dependency on Axon Framework to 4.1.

## Release 4.0

We split off the AMQP logic from Axon Framework core into a dedicated repository.
Next to that, it complies with Axon Framework's 4.0 release.
