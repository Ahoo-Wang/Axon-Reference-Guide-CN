# System Properties

The system configuration can be maintained/supplied in three ways.

* [Configuration File](configuration.md#configuration-file)
* [Command Line](configuration.md#command-line)
* [Environment Variables](configuration.md#environment-variable-s)

### _Configuration File_

The most commonly and preferred way is to have an _axonserver.properties_ or \_\_ \_axonserver.yml \_\_\*\*\_file which contains the desired configuration parameters. The location of the file should be the current working directory or alternatively can be placed within a "\_config"\_ subdirectory (relative to the current working directory).

An important note - In case both files are detected by Axon Server, it will read from both.

### _Command-Line_

In case the server is being started using “java –jar ...”, we can also supply individual configuration properties with _“-Dproperty=value”_

### _Environment Variable(s)_

Configuration values can also be supplied using environment variables. The parameter name should be all in upper case with any kebab-case(-) / camelCase and snake\_case(\_) substituted with \_"\_"\_

### _Recommendations_

There are some recommendations around Axon Server EE/SE configuration,

* Use “./axonserver.properties” for common settings.
* Use “./config/axonserver.properties” for environment/node-specific overrides.
* Use “-D” or environment variables for one-time settings.

## Configuration Properties

A list of all the configuration properties by area is denoted below. Unless explicitly specified all property names are to be prefixed with "_axoniq.axonserver_"
