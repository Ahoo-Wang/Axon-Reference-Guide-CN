# Monitoring

AxonServer provides a set of [actuator endpoints](actuator-endpoints.md) that help monitor vital aspects of an AxonServer SE/EE deployment. 

The endpoints help in :

* Retrieving basic information about the AxonServer 
* Monitoring the general health of the AxonServer
* Retrieving Metrics around the OS/JVM
* Retrieving Message \(Commands/Queries/Events\) flow metrics
* Retrieving environmental properties of the AxonServer
